- documenation: commenting above function etc. + readme
- testing: workflow in github when pulling from stage to main -- wcag, lint, something api
- readability: descriptive names for components, variables and functions

## questions
- vite: up and running fast
- redux: not used before, interested in trying its approach to loader and action

- ci/cd: 
- translation/localization: 
- tracking/analytics:
